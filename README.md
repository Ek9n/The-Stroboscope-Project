# The-Stroboscope-Project: A Mechatronic Art Installation
A mechatronic art installation explores perception through a rotating 3D-printed sphere and dynamic lighting. Developed at Fablab Neukölln, the piece challenges our understanding of time and movement. Featured in the Workish art exhibition, it merges technology with artistic vision.

## Temporal Illusion

Nestled within a translucent, church-like glass structure, this mechatronic art piece explores the delicate boundaries between motion, perception, and temporal experience. At the heart of the installation, a precisely 3D-printed sphere becomes a canvas of intricate geometric patterns, rotating with an ethereal grace that captivates the viewer.
The immersive environment is carefully crafted to heighten sensory perception. A darkened room serves as the backdrop, where strategically implemented stroboscopic lighting creates a mesmerizing atmospheric landscape. The nuanced manipulation of light frequency subtly transforms the sphere's perceived patterns, generating an optical illusion that challenges the viewer's understanding of time and movement.
This collaborative project, developed at Fablab Neukölln (Fablab NK) in partnership with designer Daiana Rotchen, was a featured piece in this year's Workish art exhibition. By blending advanced mechatronic technologies with artistic vision, the installation invites observers into a surreal, contemplative space where technological precision meets aesthetic wonder.
