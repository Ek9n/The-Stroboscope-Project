# The-Stroboscope-Project
A mechatronic art installation explores perception through a rotating 3D-printed sphere and dynamic lighting. Developed at Fablab Neuk√∂lln, the piece challenges our understanding of time and movement. Featured in the Workish art exhibition, it merges technology with artistic vision.
